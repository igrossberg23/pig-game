# Pig Game

This is a **2-player dice game**. This project was created as part of [The Complete Javascript Course  2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

The majority of the HTML/CSS foundation was developed by the course instructor. The Javascript was written by me alongside the instructor as part of the course.


### How to play:

- Each player takes turns rolling the dice. After each roll, the player is allowed to pick between rolling again or holding:
    - Rolling again: provides the opportunity to accumulate more points
    - Holding: locks in the current point total
- If the player rolls a 1, they lose all current points and the turn ends
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game
- Click  *New Game* to play again!
